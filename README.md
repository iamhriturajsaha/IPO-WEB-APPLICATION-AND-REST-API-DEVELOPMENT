# üåêIPO Web Application and REST API Development

## üßæ Project Overview

This project is developed as part of the Bluestock Fintech Internship Program and focuses on building a **production-grade full-stack IPO Web Application**. It includes -

- A **client-facing IPO listing module** (Upcoming IPO Web Page)
- A complete **Admin Dashboard** for IPO management
- A secure and scalable **REST API backend**
- **JWT-based authentication**
- **PostgreSQL** as the primary database

This solution is suitable for integration into stock market platforms, IPO tracking apps or client-side fintech tools.

## üöÄ Key Modules

### 1. Upcoming IPO Webpage (User-Facing)

- Standalone module for displaying upcoming IPOs.
- Uses REST API to fetch data dynamically.
- Displays IPOs in a card/grid layout with -
  - Company Name
  - Price Band
  - IPO Open/Close Dates
  - Lot Size
  - Issue Size
  - Listing Date
  - Status Tags (Upcoming / Ongoing / Closed / Listed)
- Includes search, filters (by date, sector), pagination.
- Fully responsive across desktop, tablet and mobile.
- Pixel-perfect UI based on Figma design.

### 2. IPO Admin Dashboard

- Admin login with static form validation + JWT token.
- CRUD operations on IPO data -
  - Add new IPO
  - Edit existing IPO
  - Delete IPO
- Interactive form with validation and real-time feedback.
- Admin Dashboard Table with search/sort.
- Data directly synced with backend via REST API.
- Protected routes (JWT-secured) for sensitive operations.

### 3. REST API Backend

- Implemented using Django / NodeJS / Spring Boot.
- Built using modular MVC or similar clean architecture.
- JWT token-based authentication.
- PostgreSQL database integration with schema & seed data.
- API documentation and testing done via Postman.
- Handles -
  - User login & token issuance
  - IPO data CRUD
  - Validation, error handling & auth middleware

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT-based** token system for admin login.
- Login route returns token on success.
- Tokens stored in localStorage/sessionStorage in frontend.
- Protected backend routes require JWT in `Authorization` header.
- Middleware handles unauthorized access with 401 errors.

## üß™ API Endpoints Overview

| Method | Endpoint            | Description                  | Auth |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------|------|
| POST   | `/api/login`        | Admin login (JWT token)      | ‚úÖ  |
| GET    | `/api/ipos`         | Get all IPOs                 | ‚úÖ  |
| GET    | `/api/ipos/:id`     | Get IPO by ID                | ‚úÖ  |
| POST   | `/api/ipos`         | Add new IPO                  | ‚úÖ  |
| PUT    | `/api/ipos/:id`     | Update IPO                   | ‚úÖ  |
| DELETE | `/api/ipos/:id`     | Delete IPO                   | ‚úÖ  |

---

## üß™ API Testing (Postman)

All REST APIs have been tested in Postman with authentication headers and payload validation.

- Admin login generates token.
- CRUD endpoints tested with valid/invalid tokens.
- Backend handles -
  - Validation errors (400)
  - Unauthorized access (401)
  - Success responses (200/201)
  - Resource not found (404)
